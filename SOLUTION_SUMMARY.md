# üé§ Microphone Access Solution - Summary

## Problem Solved
‚úÖ **Fixed**: Microphone recording not working when accessing Scratch WWW via Docker container IP address

## Root Cause
Modern browsers require HTTPS for microphone access (except localhost). When accessing via IP address like `http://192.168.1.100:8333`, browsers block microphone functionality for security reasons.

## Solution Implemented
**Nginx Reverse Proxy with SSL Termination** - A clean, production-ready approach that:

```
Browser (HTTPS) ‚Üí Nginx (SSL Termination) ‚Üí Scratch WWW (HTTP)
     :443              :80 ‚Üí :443              :8333
```

## Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Generate SSL certificates
npm run docker:setup-ssl

# 2. Start with nginx reverse proxy
npm run docker:up:prod

# 3. Access via HTTPS (microphone enabled)
https://your-ip-address
```

## What Was Added

### 1. Nginx Configuration (`docker/nginx/nginx.conf`)
- SSL termination with self-signed certificates
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- Security headers (HSTS, XSS protection, etc.)
- WebSocket support for real-time features
- Static asset caching
- Request size limits for project uploads

### 2. SSL Certificate Generation (`ssl/generate-certs.sh`)
- Self-signed certificates with Subject Alternative Names
- Supports localhost and common IP ranges
- Easy regeneration script

### 3. Updated Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`)
- **Default**: nginx + scratch-www (production with HTTPS)
- **Dev profile**: nginx-dev + scratch-www-dev (development with hot reload)
- **Direct profile**: scratch-www-direct (testing without nginx)

### 4. Enhanced NPM Scripts
- `npm run docker:setup-ssl` - Generate certificates
- `npm run docker:up:prod` - Start with nginx (recommended)
- `npm run docker:up:dev` - Development with nginx
- `npm run docker:up:direct` - Direct access (testing)

## Access Methods

| Method | URL | Microphone | Use Case |
|--------|-----|------------|----------|
| **HTTPS (Recommended)** | `https://your-ip` | ‚úÖ Works | Production, any IP |
| **HTTP** | `http://your-ip` | ‚ùå Redirects to HTTPS | Auto-redirect |
| **Localhost HTTP** | `http://localhost:8333` | ‚úÖ Works | Development only |

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `docker/nginx/nginx.conf` - Nginx reverse proxy configuration
- `ssl/generate-certs.sh` - SSL certificate generation script
- `ssl/server.crt` & `ssl/server.key` - SSL certificates
- `MICROPHONE_FIX.md` - Detailed documentation
- `test-setup.sh` - Setup validation script

### Modified Files
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added nginx services and profiles
- `package.json` - Added new Docker scripts
- `DOCKER.md` - Added microphone fix documentation

## Why This Solution?

### ‚úÖ Advantages
1. **Production Ready**: Standard nginx reverse proxy pattern
2. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns (SSL vs app logic)
3. **Performance**: nginx optimized for SSL and static content
4. **Security**: Proper headers and SSL configuration
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add load balancing or multiple backends
6. **Flexible**: Multiple deployment profiles for different use cases

### üîÑ Alternative Approaches Considered
- **Node.js HTTPS**: More complex, less performant
- **Traefik**: Overkill for single service
- **Cloud Load Balancer**: Not suitable for local development

## Browser Security Warning
Since we use self-signed certificates, browsers show a security warning. This is expected and safe for development. Users need to:
1. Click "Advanced" 
2. Click "Proceed to [site] (unsafe)"

## Production Deployment
For production, replace self-signed certificates with:
- **Let's Encrypt** (free, automated)
- **Commercial SSL** (purchased from CA)

## Testing
Run `./test-setup.sh` to validate the complete setup before starting services.

**Result**: Microphone functionality now works when accessing Scratch WWW via any IP address through HTTPS! üéâ
